What about turning your reports early to do some peer-review?

What is interoperability?


---
class: center, middle

Interoperability:
 In time and in space

 Interoperability:
 - Hardware
 - Operating System
 - Client
 - Language

Interoperability through reverse-engineering


---

""Interoperability implies Open standards"" (Wikipedia)


---
class: center, middle


Different level of interoperability:

1. Active obfuscation
2. Closed source implementation without obfuscation
3. Documentation of the format
4. Documentation and open source reference implementation
5. A diverse group working to standardise the format.
6. A standard recognised by a standardisation organisation  (ISO, OASIS, …)

Standardisation is great but usage is more important

???

This is often forgotten in the Open Source community

De-facto standard : either non-standardised format (word 97) or bad implementation of an existing standard (Outlook emails)

- Open source cannot work with closed format because implementing them is already a form of documentation. 
- Open source is good for interoperability. 
- Interoperability needs open source, at least for a reference implementation.

What is decentralisation?

Centralised vs distributed vs decentralised vs federation

Why is decentralisation hard : because you cannot trust other members of the network.

Benefits of decentralisation:

1. Better resilience of the overal system against attacks (survivability)
2. Privacy and security (distributed trust)

Problems:

1. Agreements on protocol changes
2. Upgrading nodes of the network
3. Spam
4. Complexity (implementation)
5. Complexity (UX)
6. Social acceptance of problems
7. Tendancy to recentralise (everyone on the same instance)


"Nobody was ever fired for choosing Microsoft"


Most decentralised network still have centralised parts (like routes, directories (see XMPP))



Examples : Mail, XMPP, Mastodon, Diaspora

It tooks XMPP years to have user avatars (XEP-0084) and, worst, the most popular XMPP client at the time (Psi) was using something else.


Some decentralised network widely used:
- Emails
- WWW  (was not always the case, example AOL)
- SMS

and…  that's mostly it. Anything else?

Emails is now mainly centralised to Gmail, Outlook (hotmail) and Yahoo.
WWW is now mainly centralised to Google, Facebook, Amazon S3.
Example of OVH failing.
SMS is also quite centralised.

People tends to centralise.

Bitcoin mining. Popular Diaspora instances.
