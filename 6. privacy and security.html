#What is security?

Difference between true security and feeling of security

Example of the security theater. -> military in the street actually make the street less secure!

Security is making it harder to break a rule. It is usually never "impossible". Only harder or slower. Example of the bike lock.

True security is the security of your weakest link. Example of the bottled water at airport.

The weakest link is most than often external trust. If your security depends on trust, it may be deceived.

Security is not always good. Sometimes, we want to be able to break the rules.

How do we create a true security without trusting external entity but that we can bypass if needed to progress?

Network of trust.

Cryptography.

Why Open Source?

Open Source is a necessary condition to build security. But not sufficiant.

You need security to implement privacy. Without security, you cannot prevent spying of your life. You need a closed door to go to the toilet.

As security, there's a difference between true privacy and feeling of privacy.

Granular privacy.

Two strategies for better privacy:

Cryptographic: Signal, Keybase

Decentralization (ak network of trust): Mastodon, Diaspora

snake oil cryptography : I invented something I can't break. So it must be good.
